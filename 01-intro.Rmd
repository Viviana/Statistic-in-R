## R Studio 

R by itself is just the ‘beating heart’ of R programming, but it has no particular user interface. R Studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This program serves as a text editor, data manager, and package library to help you read and write R code. You can create **R script, R Markdown, Shiny App, run Python script** and many more in R Studio. 

### Create a project, an R script and set up work directory

In your RStudio, create **a new project** under the tab "File" and **select a preferred file location**. Project allows you to keep all the files associated with a project organized together, each with their own working directory, workspace, history, and source documents.

Download **the R Markdown** and **the dataset** titled birthweight_smoking.csv from the Moodle site to **the same location ** for your project. 

Then, open the **R Script**. R Script is a series of commands that you can execute at one time and you can save lot of time. script is just a plain text file with R commands in it.

## Running R codes  

Use  `COMMAND`+`ENTER` key on Mac, and `CONTROL`+ `ENTER` key on PC to run a R script one line at a time. 
(Put your cursor to the line of code you want to run!) To run multiple lines, just select them and run.

RStudio has a large number of useful keyboard shortcuts, check them out using a keyboard shortcut:

- On Windows: `Alt` + `Shift` + `K`
- On Mac:  `Option` + `Shift` + `K`

The `RStudio` team has developed [a number of "cheatsheets"](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) for working with both `R` and `RStudio`.
 
 
## Variable Assignment  

`<-` is a left assignment operator in R (i.e., to command R to assign values to vectors, which are the codes after the arrow)

These operators are used to assign values to variables.

```{r}
a <- "this is my first line of R code"

a

# a is the object you want to specify and want R to remember! 

```

Can you repeat the following example and introduce yourself to R?

```{r}
Viviana <- "Viviana is the instructor of SPP608. She does research on philanthropy and nonprofits and their policy roles online and offline."  

Viviana       # check if R stores the answer for you.


# Your turn:

yourname <- "write anything in this quote within the quotation mark."

yourname  # run the variable

year <- 2

year

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. We will be using R Markdown for **all your assignments and quizzes**. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

For more examples on R code chunk, see learnr lesson 3: <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html>

## What is a data frame?

A data frame is a rectangular collection of values, usually organized so that **observations** appear in rows (unique entities, such as student id) and variables appear in the **columns** (such as height, GPA). 

### dim()   
Examine the dimensions of your dataset, it returns two numbers: (1) # of Rows (2) # of Columns.	


## Step 1: Import a .csv Dataset

'data' is the variable where the data will be stored.  If the parameter "header=" is "TRUE", then the first row will be treated as the row names. These data were reported in Almond, D., Chay, K. Y., & Lee, D. S. (2005). The costs of low birth weight. *The Quarterly Journal of Economics*, 120(3), 1031-1083. which is made available via Stock, J. H., & Watson, M. W. (2020). *Introduction to Econometrics.* 4th ed. Pearson. NY: New York. 

R Studio Cloud/Desktop: When you saved the csv dataset in *your project folder*, you can load the data easily

If your data is not stored in the project folder, you will need to insert the full path for your data, remember to use the forward slash '/". Remove the # to run the following code. 

```{r}
smoking_data <- read.csv("birthweight_smoking.csv",header=TRUE, sep=",") 

# smoking_data is the name we assign for the .csv dataset, 
# that's how R calls this dataset from now on! 

```
Now on your right panel in your global environment, you should see 'smoking_data' stored. 

***

## Step 2. Exploratory Data Analysis  

### dim()   

Examine the dimensions of your dataset, it returns two numbers: (1) # of Rows (2) # of Columns.	
```{r}
dim(smoking_data)
```

### colnames()
What are the variables included in the dataset?
```{r}
colnames(smoking_data)
```

### head()
`head()` shows the first six rows of a dataset. 
```{r}
head(smoking_data)
```


### str()
Examine the data structure of the variables in the data frame (factor, numeric, integer, etc.).
```{r}
str(smoking_data)
# want to find out the current data structure?
# Next week, we will learn how to transform some of the data structure!

```

### summary()
Examine the summary statistics of variables in the dataset, what can you learn from it?
Important: Check against the "Documentation for Birthweight_Smoking.pdf" to understand the meaning of the variable and the labeling system. 

```{r}
# the entire dataset
summary(smoking_data)

# a specific variable
summary(smoking_data$birthweight)

```
